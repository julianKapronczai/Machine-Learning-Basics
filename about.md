Hello,

I'm Julian Kapronczai, a student at SAIT learning about software development(SD). 

SD has always been interesting to me, I always feel like you are just scratching the surface of something even more exciting. This is what drives my continued interest in the industy.

I'm always looking to improve my knowledge of SD, and it lead me to machine learning. Easy to understand at a super high level, but super hard to piece together one you look a bit lower. 

The aim of this blog is to introduce you to the basic concepts of machine learning. Hopefully without overwhelming you. After you read about the core concepts of machine learning, feel free to follow along with the implementation videos underneith the introductions to the topics. 

Hope you learn something! 

Good luck,

Julian Kapronczai.
